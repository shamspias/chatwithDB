# ChatWithDB

ChatWithDB is an innovative project that transforms traditional databases into conversational partners using GPT-3 and Django. It accepts user input, finds similar database entries, and crafts human-like responses using OpenAI's GPT-3, creating a unique interaction experience with databases. The project supports multiple databases, including PostgreSQL and MySQL.

## Features

- User-friendly Django admin dashboard to manage database connections.
- Integration with OpenAI's GPT-3 to process user queries and responses.
- Advanced text similarity search with different databases.
- APIs to facilitate user interaction with databases.

## Installation

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/shamspias/ChatWithDB.git
cd ChatWithDB
```

Install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure your database in `settings.py`, then apply migrations:

```sh
python manage.py migrate
```

Start the Django development server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```

The server should be running on `localhost:8000`.

## Usage
